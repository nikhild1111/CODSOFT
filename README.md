# CODSOFT - C++ Programming Internship 🚀

This repository contains all the tasks I completed during my 2-month C++ internship at CODSOFT. These projects helped me strengthen my core C++ programming skills through practical implementations.

## 📋 Internship Details

**Company:** CODSOFT  
**Duration:** 2 Months  
**Role:** C++ Programming Intern  
**Focus:** Building console applications and mastering C++ fundamentals

## 🎯 Tasks Completed

### **Task 1: Number Guessing Game**

Built an interactive game where the computer generates a random number and the player tries to guess it.

**What it does:**
- Generates random number within a range
- Takes user guesses and provides hints (too high/too low)
- Counts attempts and shows score
- Option to play again

**What I learned:**
- Using `rand()` and `srand()` for random numbers
- Implementing game loops with while/for loops
- Input validation and error handling
- Creating interactive console programs

---

### **Task 2: Simple Calculator**

A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user.

**Features:**
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Menu-driven interface
- Handles division by zero error
- Continuous operation until user exits

**What I learned:**
- Switch-case statements for menu options
- Creating functions for each operation
- Error handling for edge cases
- Building user-friendly console interfaces

---

### **Task 3: To-Do List Application**

A task management app where users can add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks.

**Features:**
- Add new tasks
- Display all tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks to file (so they persist after closing)
- Load tasks from file on startup

**What I learned:**
- File handling with `fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`
- Working with vectors to store tasks
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Data persistence using text files
- Real-world application development

## 💡 Key Learnings

**C++ Concepts Mastered:**
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control structures (if-else, switch, loops)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays and vectors for data storage
- File I/O operations for data persistence
- Random number generation
- Input/output handling and formatting
- Error handling and validation

**Programming Skills Gained:**
- Breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts
- Writing clean, readable code with proper comments
- Validating user inputs to prevent crashes
- Handling edge cases and errors gracefully
- Building complete applications from scratch
- Testing and debugging code effectively

## 🚀 What This Internship Taught Me

**Technical Growth:**
- Got comfortable with C++ syntax and concepts
- Learned to think logically and solve problems step-by-step
- Understood how to work with files for data storage
- Practiced building real console applications

**Practical Experience:**
- Completed projects within deadlines
- Implemented user-friendly interfaces
- Handled real-world programming challenges
- Improved code quality and organization

**Challenges I Faced:**
- **File Handling** - Initially struggled with reading/writing files properly
- **Input Validation** - Took time to handle all types of invalid inputs
- **Random Numbers** - Learned to use `srand(time(0))` for truly random numbers

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

Thanks to **CODSOFT** for this internship opportunity. These tasks gave me hands-on experience with C++ and helped me build confidence in programming.
